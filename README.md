[Quicksilicon](https://quicksilicon.in/) Hands-on-RTL design course problem 3: 3 Bit Palindrome:

You are tasked to design a circuit which would detect a 3-bit palindrome sequence from incoming stream of bits.

	Palindrome code is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. 
	For example, the following are palindromes: 101, 010, 111, 000, etc.
